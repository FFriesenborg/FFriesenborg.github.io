    <h2>Master Thesis: Self-Modulation of Alpha-Peak Frequency in Brain-
Computer Interfacing</h2>
    
    <h3> In Simple Words </h3>

    <p class="justify">A BCI is a fascinating device designed to "read your thoughts," 
        enabling direct recognition of your intended computer actions without the need 
        for typing or verbal commands. One common technology employed for this purpose is EEG,
        which measures voltage differences resulting from brain activity. 
        Specific differences are correlated with distinct cognitive tasks. 
        For instance, closing the eyes results in a noticeable dip in the EEG signal,
        as depicted in the "blink artifact" image below. Essentially, one could construct
        a rudimentary BCI by alternating between eye-closed and eyes-open states,
        akin to Morse code. However, our goal is to develop a BCI that operates 
        solely through the power of thought, without relying on muscle movements.

        To achieve this, we leverage a typical EEG component known as the alpha rhythm,
        particularly focusing on the alpha peak frequency (APF), also referred to as 'PAF.'
        This peak represents the frequency component with the highest power in the alpha oscillation spectrum,
        serving as the dominant frequency within the alpha rhythm. 
        Importantly, this peak is not static but varies with different 
        cognitive tasks, such as increasing with higher cognitive load and decreasing
        during relaxation. Additionally, it undergoes changes with age, 
        with the general APF decreasing in adulthood. These aspects are excellently 
        visualized by Mierau et al. (2017) on page 148.

        Our endeavor involved training subjects to voluntarily increase and decrease their APF
        without providing specific instructions, following an operant conditioning approach. 
        While we observed some success, there remains ample room for improvement. 
        Nonetheless, based on our results, it can be concluded that utilizing APF as a BCI feature
        holds promise for achieving more stable and reliable BCI functionality.</p>

    <h3> In more complicated words </h3>

    <h4> But what is a BCI? </h3>
    <p class="justify"> 
        Since I still think the topic of my Master Thesis is somewhat 
        interesting I present it here in a small overview.
        I wrote my Master Thesis for the research group 
        Neuroinformatics in at the University of Vienna. 
        This group mainly investigates Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).
        The Brain-Computer Interface is a fascinating concept that captures
        the imagination of many, conjuring up visions of a high-tech utopia or
        dystopia. The idea of using an interface that can perceive and interpret one’s
        own thoughts without physical accessibility is both intriguing and alarming.
        However, researchers in the field of BCI are aware that we are still far from
        systems that could potentially enslave humanity as depicted in science fiction.
        Presently, BCI offers mainly opportunities to enhance the quality of
        life for individuals with physical limitations.
        BCI is a rapidly growing field of research, as evidenced by the increasing
        number of papers published on the topic in the last two decades, as can be
        seen on pubmed. Despite many recent advances, there are still numerous
        challenges that need to be addressed, including issues related to commercialization
        and providing options for individuals with severe
        motor impairments.

    <h4> Which Technology is used for this? </h3>
    <p class="justify">
        BCIs based on Electroencephalography (EEG) is an affordable and noninvasive
        method for implementing BCI systems, but there are individuals
        who do not generate classifiable brain signals in EEG-based BCI systems
        (Ahn & Jun, 2015). This problem, along with the psychological factors
        that can negatively affect performance, such as concentration, emotional
        states, fatigue, and motivation, must be addressed to enhance the reliability
        of EEG-based BCI systems. (Curran, 2003). One potential solution is to
        increase the number of signal components used as features in BCIs, allowing
        for some features to compensate for others that may not work well for specific
        individuals.
        The Alpha-Peak Frequency (APF) has recently gained attention as a
        reliable feature source in the neuroscientific field. (Mierau et al., 2017). As
        such, it raises the question of whether it can be used as a feature in BCIs.
        The resulting research question arises:
        Is it possible to self-modulate the alpha-peak frequency
        and, therefore, use it as feature for BCIs?
