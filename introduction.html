    <h2>Introduction and Self-Description</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Fabian. Welcome to my personal website!</p>
    <p>I thought about creating this small site to give interested people a possibilities to look further in what I've done with my time.
    
 I have a profound interest in data in all its forms. I never thought I'd develop such a layman's interest, but apparently, 
        working with them excessively forces you to appreciate them after a while (a bit of an intellectual Stockholm Syndrome, I guess).
        Besides that, I enjoy chess and building things, both digital and physical (also in a layman's style). 
        I'm not very skilled at chess, but I enjoy building things that are essential, like a bedframe, an open closet, or a dart protection board. Not always beautiful, they do their job.</p>
